# Using Firecloud-in-a-Box

## Architecture

Firecloud-in-a-Box (FiaB) is a stack of docker containers that comprise the application Firecloud and its microservices and APIs, running on a Google Compute instance.

### Cloud Architecture

While the FiaB docker containers run on a single GCE instance, they utilize both GCloud and GSuite resources to function.  

Within GCloud, FiaB needs 
- a Google Billing Account to charge compute costs to 
- oauth credentials to authenticate each service API
- service accounts with different IAM privileges to perform actions on resources
- Google buckets to store data
- the ability to create/destroy GCE instances to run analysis on
- access to a number of other GCloud APIs

Within GSuite, FiaB needs
- a number of user accounts to act via service accounts as authenticated users
- a number of groups
- API scopes on GCloud service accounts to allow them to perform actions on users and groups, including creating groups

### Docker architecture



All services run on the same IP, but in separate docker containers. Most services consist of an application container, a proxy container which HTTP/HTTPS traffic is routed through, and containers for any dependent databases or directories. They are differentiated by port number. 

See the diagram below for a more detailed look at the container architecture.

## Usage

Once you've started FiaB on a GCE instance, you can map the IP of your instance onto the DNS entries corresponding to your SSL certs.  
Modify the `/etc/hosts` file on your machine and add the following line, where `$DOMAIN` is your DNS domain (i.e. `fiabftw.firecloud.org`):
```
[YOUR FIAB IP] firecloud-fiab.$DOMAIN firecloud-orchestration-fiab.$DOMAIN duos-fiab.$DOMAIN consent-fiab.$DOMAIN consent-ontology-fiab.$DOMAIN agora-fiab.$DOMAIN cromwell-fiab.$DOMAIN rawls-fiab.$DOMAIN sam-fiab.$DOMAIN thurloe-fiab.$DOMAIN leonardo-fiab.$DOMAIN
```

Then, each service can be reached with its specific DNS name and port number:
* Library Service (Agora) - `https://agora-fiab.$DOMAIN:20443`
* Execution Service (Cromwell) - `https://cromwell-fiab.$DOMAIN:21443`
* Firecloud UI - `https://firecloud-fiab.$DOMAIN:22443`
* Firecloud API (Orchestration) - `https://firecloud-orchestration-fiab.$DOMAIN:23443`
* Workspaces Service (Rawls) - `https://rawls-fiab.$DOMAIN:24443`
* User Profile Service (Thurloe) - `https://thurloe-fiab.$DOMAIN:25443`
* DUOS UI (Consent UI) - `https://duos-fiab.$DOMAIN:26443`
* DUOS API (Consent) - `https://consent-fiab.$DOMAIN:27443`
* Ontology - `https://consent-ontology-fiab.$DOMAIN:28443`
* IAM Service (Sam) - `https://sam-fiab.$DOMAIN:29443`
* Notebooks Service (Leonardo) - `https://leonardo-fiab.$DOMAIN:30443`

### Debugging

You can SSH onto your FiaB host via the gcloud CLI:
```
gcloud compute ssh --project [google proj] [fiab host]
```

Once inside the host, the configuration directories for each service, as well as the database and directory stores, can be found at `/FiaB`. 
The database and directory stores (`mongostore`, `mysqlstore`, `ldapstore`, `opendjstore`) are where the database and directory containers write out their state, so that the state can persist
even if the docker containers crash or are stopped.  Stopping FiaB will clear these directories, thus resetting the db state. 

To view all running containers, run:
```
docker ps
```

To view the logs for a specific container, run:
```
docker logs [container name]
```
You can also tail the logs in real time by adding the `-t -f` flags to the above command.

## Migrations

As the Firecloud service stack continues to develop, changes may be made in resources outside of the docker images or configs, such as changes to vault secrets or google resources (service accounts, groups, firewall rules, etc).
To keep abreast of the latest changes, run the migration script regularly:
```
./migrate.sh [google proj] [google apps domain] [dns domain] [admin email] [env]
```

## Running on multiple VMs
FIAB is not a scalable, production-ready installation. It's useful for development, troubleshooting and testing. In production, FireCloud should be run on multiple machines. 

1. At this point you should have dockers, docker-composes and conf files. If you open the docker-compose files, you'll see where the confs are injected and other variables. 
1. Docker-composes link all the containers together with Docker Networking. If you want to run on multiple nodes, you'll have to change the `link:` functions in the docker-compose and change conf files to point to "real" machines. That also means setting up DNS for each "real" machine.
1. In practice, Broad sets this all up using Terraform. Here are our templates: https://github.com/broadinstitute/terraform-firecloud.  
1. In practice, this requires a bunch of prerequisites including Vault and Puppet. A user can use any Docker-enabled node to run any service that we run. 
1. The user is responsible for their own deployment process of getting conf files, certs, etc onto machines that are going to be mounted into the Dockers via docker-compose.
1. There's a nuance in GCE in that VMs can't route to other VMs in the same project via their external address. So if serverA wants to talk to serverB, it has to do so through the private IP. That means 2 DNS names for each server (public and private) and the conf files have to point to the appropriate one.
1. In practice: If Rawls wants to talk to Cromwell, it has to use Cromwell-priv address.
1. Most of our services are usually deployed behind Google load-balancers. These face the outside world and provide a routable external address. This means that, in actuality, most of the microservices face the outside world. Cromwell doesn't, though, nor do things like Elastic Search and Mongo, so if those live on individual VMs, machines that talk to those services have to use the Priv address.
1. This also means that the Apache Proxies that sit in front of each service have to be configured for SERVER_NAME as well as SERVER_NAME_ALIASES. 
1. This is also why we require a wildcard SSL cert -- so that a single cert can service all names.

### Examples:

1. In the apache conf: https://github.com/broadinstitute/firecloud-develop/blob/dev/base-configs/agora/site.conf.ctmpl#L38
1. In the docker-compose: https://github.com/broadinstitute/firecloud-develop/blob/dev/run-context/live/configs/agora/proxy-compose.yaml.ctmpl#L27

## Cromwell "scaling"

1. Cromwell currently has a 1-1 relationship with a MySQL database. That means that if you want to run multiple Cromwells for load reasons, it's a "shard" approach. You can spin up another Cromwell but it won't have a shared database. Once a job is on one Cromwell it stays there in perpetuity.
1. Other than spinning up another Cromwell, rawls has to be told to use it: https://github.com/broadinstitute/firecloud-develop/blob/dev/base-configs/rawls/rawls.conf.ctmpl#L82 . These conf lines show an array full of Cromwells in Live Production environments. 
1. We have a beta going on (rolling into production 6/18) using Internal Google Load balancers and URL maps to have a Master-Read Cromwell scaling. This WILL enable Cromwell to have a single Writer and N readers so that if the Writer is overwhelmed, it won't break most of Firecloud/Rawls.
1. When Cromwell As A Service exists, one of its requirements is to have horizontal scalabiility across the board. The above are all stopgaps until that happens.

## Scaling everything else

1. As noted, most of our other functions can be scaled already but putting them behind Google load balancers with multiple instances. These include as of this writing: 
     * agora
     * thurloe
     * Orchestration
     * UI
     * rawls
     * sam
1. Leo has not been tested yet to be a Load Balanced service. We're pretty sure it works but unknown.
1. OpenDJ (part of the Sam suite) has it's own load balancing. It is not to be exposed to the outside world. Unless your load is very large, keep it on the Sam machine.
1. Elastic Search and Mongo have their own scaling/multi-node methodologies.
